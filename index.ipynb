    "# ID3 Classification Trees: Perfect Split with Information Gain  - Lab\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will simulate the example from the previous lesson in python. We will write functions to calculate entropy and IG which will be used for calculating these uncertainty measures and deciding upon creating a split using information gain while growing a ID3 classification tree. We shall attempt to write general function that can be used for other (larger)  problems as well. So let's get on with it. \n",

    "## Objectives\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "- Write functions for calculating Entropy and Information gain measures\n",
    "- Identify the attribute for best split at master and each subsequent node\n"
